* Express
* MongoDB
* CSS
* fireBase


# #Libraries Used 🌟

All the image and icon links have been taken from the main website ( https://www.youTube.com/ )



# # End Notes 📑

In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with the help of all the new Tech stack like React and node.
This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Although we could have done more, time did not allow us to go further. But we must improve it.
